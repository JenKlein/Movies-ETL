# Movies-ETL
This project was an introduction to the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process. The purpose was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, then load it in to existing tables. Movies data was extracted from Wikipedia and Kaggle, the data was cleaned and combined, then loaded them into a SQL database for hackathon participants to use.
